In this package, there are two folders: code and results

In the folder 'code', there are our implementations of reduction techniques, and the scripts used in our empirical study.

In the folder 'results', there are complete results of our study.

	correlation: 
		the complete results of our empirical study investigating the influence of assertions on coverage-based test suite reduction.

		dataCovRF refers to the results of the influence of the assertion coverage reduction on fault-detection capability loss

		dataCovRS refers to the results of the influence of the assertion coverage reduction on test suite size reduction

		dataNumRF refers to the results of the influence of the assertion count reduction on fault-detection capability loss

		dataNumRS refers to the results of the influence of the assertion count reduction on test suite size reduction
